Thats why having a pet to help with those battles is so important. Yet, being in the military makes it almost impossible to care for a pet with constant training and deployments. That's where Battle Buddies takes a stand! To give military personnel the ability to have a pet no matter how long they may be gone protecting our freedom.</h5>
